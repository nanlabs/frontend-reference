# react-hook-form Frontend

The goal of this project is to create an example of how we could create a complex form using the npm package [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/).

Another objective is to provide good examples of how to use the different features offered by react-hook-form, as well as other technologies such as [zod](https://zod.dev/) for validation.

All the research and work done in this project are based on the [documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started/) provided by the official react-hook-form web site.

This project was done using the template created by [create-awesome-node-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-awesome-node-app) as a starting point.
