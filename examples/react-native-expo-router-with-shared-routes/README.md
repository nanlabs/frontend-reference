# Frontend template for a React Native Expo

This is a template for a React Native Expo app with TypeScript, ESLint, prettier, and expo-router. Also you have a minimal example for expo-router.

## Getting Started

## Dev Tools

- âš› [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is used for UI.
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for easy development.
- ðŸ¦¾ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - type safe.

## Requirements

You need nodejs version 18, you can check the specific version in the .node-version file.

## Quickstart

```sh
fnm use
npm install
npm run start
# or for a clean start
npx expo start -c
```

## Development

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npx expo start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

| `npm run <script>` | Description                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
