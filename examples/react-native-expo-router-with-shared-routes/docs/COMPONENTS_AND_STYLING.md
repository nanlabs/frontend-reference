# ðŸ§± Components And Styling

## Components Best Practices

### Colocate things as close as possible to where it's being used

Keep components, functions, styles, state, etc. as close as possible to the component where it's being used. This will not only make your codebase more readable and easier to understand but it will also improve your application performance since it will reduce redundant re-renders on state updates.

### Avoid large components with nested rendering functions

Do not add multiple rendering functions inside your application, this gets out of control pretty quickly. What you should do instead is if there is a piece of UI that can be considered as a unit, is to extract it in a separate component.

```javascript
// this is very difficult to maintain as soon as the component starts growing
function Component() {
  function renderItems() {
    return <ul>...</ul>;
  }
  return <div>{renderItems()}</div>;
}

// extract it in a separate component
function Items() {
  return <ul>...</ul>;
}

function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Items />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Stay consistent

### Limit the number of props a component is accepting as input

If your component is accepting too many props you might consider splitting it into multiple components or use the composition technique via children or slots.

### Abstract shared components into a component library

For larger projects, it is a good idea to build abstractions around all the shared components. It makes the application more consistent and easier to maintain. Identify repetitions before creating the components to avoid wrong abstractions.

It is a good idea to wrap third-party components as well in order to adapt them to the application's needs. It might be easier to make the underlying changes in the future without affecting the application's functionality.

## Component libraries

Every project requires some UI components such as modals, tabs, sidebars, menus, etc. Instead of building those from scratch, you might want to use some of the existing, battle-tested component libraries.
